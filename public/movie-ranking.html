<h1>The Best Movies according to Chandu Nallamothu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of All Time!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>The CGI is superb and the plot is amazing. But I am very sad the actor passed away and I think that was the downfall for Marvel after that. That year in 8th grade I saw the best marvel movies ever produced other than Captain Marvel.</p>

<h3>Cars</h3>
<p>This was one that started my passion for cars so I love it. Even though it was sad that Doc passed away in the second one.</p>

<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</h3>
<p>The acting between the couple is amazing with their on screen and off screen chemistry. I love secret agent movies in general so it was one that I enjoyed thouroughly. Although  I have not yet seen the show on amazon prime yet.</p>
